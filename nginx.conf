    # This block is for local development or if Nginx is acting as a reverse proxy
    # In a Kubernetes environment with an Ingress Controller, this might not be needed
    # as the Ingress Controller would handle routing /api to the backend service.
    # If you want to test locally with docker-compose, uncomment and adjust:
    # location /api/ {
    #     proxy_pass http://backend-service:5000; # Replace with your backend service name/IP
    # }
